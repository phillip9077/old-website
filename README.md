# Phillip Wei's Personal Website/Portfolio

**Version 1.0**

HTML code files and a CSS file for my portfolio website

This is a website dedicated to highlighting my computer science portfolio. I wanted to produce this website to, not only showcase
my personal projects and experiences, but also to learn HTML/CSS. Just like any coding language, I know I have only scratched the surface,
but any new topic requires us to start from scratch!

Right now I am mainly experimenting with CSS and seeing how I can incorporate a more elegant website design. Once I better understand CSS, I will finish the rest of my website accordingly. Perhaps after the main structure and design of the website is finished, I could learn JavaScript and make my website even more interactive.
