# Phillip Wei's Personal Website/Portfolio

**Version 1.1**

This is a website dedicated to highlighting my computer science portfolio. I wanted to produce this website to, not only showcase
my personal projects and work experiences, but also to learn more about web design. I know I have only scratched the surface,
but with each commit I gain further insight on a topic I feel intrigued about. 

I have incorporated some JavaScript into my website as well as CSS fundamental to a polished look. The next step for me is to continue designing the website to the best of my ability, perhaps by discussing with my CS peers or consulting with my friends who major in art design!

Known Bugs:
    Hamburger menu doesn't show up in front of the homepage on some iOS devices, will work on a fix as soon as possible.
