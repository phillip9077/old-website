# Phillip Wei's Personal Website/Portfolio

**Version 1.1**

HTML code files and a CSS file for my portfolio website

This is a website dedicated to highlighting my computer science portfolio. I wanted to produce this website to, not only showcase
my personal projects and experiences, but also to learn HTML/CSS. Just like any coding language, I know I have only scratched the surface,
but any new topic requires us to start from scratch!

I have acquired a better understanding of CSS, so I'm currently experimenting with simple JavaScript animations/transitions. The next step for me is to research on how to make the website more professional and well-designed, perhaps by discussing future plans with web design professors or my fellow web design peers.
